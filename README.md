# Start date- 02/01/26.
First, I wrote the application code using Python and Flask.
After completing the code, I installed the required dependency using the command:

pip install flask

Then I started the Flask development server using the command:

python app.py

After running this command, the Flask server started on port 5000.
I opened the generated URL in the browser (http://127.0.0.1:5000) and successfully accessed the application.
